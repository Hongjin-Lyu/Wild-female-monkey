## 1. Interpretation of CO₂ Plots

In the CO₂ concentration plots from Lesson 1, the vertical axis does not start at 0. According to Healy, Chapter 1.6, this design choice aims to emphasize the subtle variations in CO₂ levels over time. By not starting from 0, small fluctuations in the data become more visible, helping to highlight trends that might otherwise be overlooked.

If the vertical axis were to start at 0, the overall changes in CO₂ concentration would appear less dramatic. While this approach reduces the risk of exaggerating differences, it could also make important environmental trends harder to detect. Therefore, understanding the axis scale is crucial when interpreting such data visualizations.

## 2. Analysis of Hans Rosling's Visualization

### Variables in the Visualization

- **X-axis (Income):** Represents *GDP per capita (PPPs inflation-adjusted)*, indicating the average income per person.
- **Y-axis (Babies per Woman):** Represents the *fertility rate*, showing the average number of children born per woman.
- **Color:** Indicates different *world regions* (e.g., Asia, Europe, Africa), helping to visually distinguish countries.
- **Size:** Reflects the *population size* of each country, with larger bubbles representing larger populations.

### Most Difficult Feature for Quantitative Comparison

According to Healy, Chapter 1, the **bubble size (population)** is the most difficult feature for making quantitative comparisons. This is because humans are not naturally good at accurately comparing areas, especially when the size differences are subtle. Unlike precise axis scales or distinct colors, area perception lacks clear reference points, making it easy to misjudge.

*Do I agree?* Yes, I agree with this assessment. Comparing exact population sizes based on bubble area can be misleading, while comparing positions on the x and y axes is much clearer due to defined scales.

### Effectiveness of the Visualization

In my judgment, this visualization is **highly effective** despite its complexity:

- The **dynamic animation** helps illustrate trends over time clearly.
- The use of **color coding** and **interactive features** (like mouse-over tooltips) enhances data exploration.
- **Rosling's TED Talk** adds significant value, as his live explanations guide the audience through the data, making complex information easy to understand.

Overall, the visualization succeeds in communicating complex global development trends in an engaging and accessible way.
